# Air-Pollution-Prediction_diploma-thesis

Prediction of five air pollutants (O3, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5) for four cities (Athens, Paris, Delhi, Beijing)<br>
using statistical models **ARIMA** (auto_ARIMA and manually) and **Facebook Prophet**<br>
and also **univariate and multivariate CNN and LSTM neural networks**.<br>
The multivariate models use each pollutant's older values and also weather conditions to make predictions.<br>
The univariate models only use the pollutant's older values to make predictions.<br>
The significance of the volume of data used for training the models is also tested by repeating each experiment with less data and comparing the accuracy and errors.
