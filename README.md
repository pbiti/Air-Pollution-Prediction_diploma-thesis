# Air-Pollution-Prediction_diploma-thesis

## Prediction of five air pollutants (O3, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5) for four cities (Athens, Paris, Delhi, Beijing)
## using statistical models ARIMA (auto_ARIMA and manually) and Facebook Prophet
## and also univariate and multivariate CNN and LSTM neural networks.
## The multivariate models use each pollutant's older values and also weather conditions to make predictions.
## The univariate models only use the pollutant's older values to make predictions.
## The significance of the volume of data used for training the models is also tested by repeating each 
## experiment with less data and comparing the accuracy and errors.
